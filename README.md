# YOLOv4-vs-YOLOv4-tiny

There are two primary jupyter notebooks in the root folder containing all code and instructions to run YOLOv4 and YOLOv4-tiny on a dataset from roboflow. 
I have also added a few functions to use your webcam to capture real-time object detection.

The videos folder contains videos of YOLOv4 trained on masks and applied to a recent news video covering coronavirus.
